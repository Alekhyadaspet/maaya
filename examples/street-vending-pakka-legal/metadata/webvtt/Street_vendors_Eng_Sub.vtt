00:00:05.023 --> 00:00:07.017
STREET VENDING :PAKKA LEGAL!

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.002
Kumar and kamala were farmers.

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.008
When there were no rains , they were forced to move to the city ,

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:16.008
leaving behind their daughter Shanthi.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.006
With the help of some relatives , they became street vendors .

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.018
In the city , they met Shantha  Mary and Muniraju .

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:25.016
Two other vendors who sold on the same street .

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:31.019
�I grew up in Bangalore and live in a slum nearby�, Muniraju told them .

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:39.023
�For many years , I have been selling fruits .There are no other jobs for people like me without education.

00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:46.022
�I live in the same slum said Shantha Mary. �My husband doesn�t have a job. I have two sons.�

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:46.022
Everyday Kumar and Kamala would go to market at 3 AM .

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:51.006
Everyday Kumar and Kamala would go to market at 3 AM .

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:56.001
To get fresh vegetables, carrying heavy bags and baskets in the bus.

00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:02.006
Be it rain , heat , or cold weather , they stood in their spot and vended.

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.002
A few months passed and slowly they started to get regular customers.

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:09.007
The businessman shakeel was one such regular.

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:15.022
Another was Anitha�s grandmother . The school bus dropped little Anitha near their  cart everyday ,

00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:20.001
and she would wait with Kamala until her grandmother picked her up.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.004
And then there was a policeman named shiva.

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:27.021
Whose sister lived nearby. But even with all these new friends ,

00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:32.001
Kumar and Kamala still missed their home, and they often thought about their farm.

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:36.019
In six months � time , Kumar had found a second job as a �Gardener�.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:39.011
And kamala also found another job, supplying tea.

00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:45.021
Soon , it was almost a year since they first made the city as their home .

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:52.015
They managed to save enough to move to a rented house , their daughter Shanthi also joined them.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:55.018
Little did they know what was to come.

00:01:55.018 --> 00:02:02.000
�our boss is going to build a mall here .� �But where will we go?� asked the vendors.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.009
   The thugs became aggressive. "what you are doing is illegal! you can't be on the road.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:14.021
one week. remember. if you don't leave -- you don't want to wait and find out what will happen."

00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:20.007
The next day, the policeman shiva came to their cart to buy vegetables for his sister.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:24.001
"en aithu?" shiva asked. "why are you both looking so sad?'

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:30.001
"they are evicting us. sir. "Said kumar."But with the new law,

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.011
no one can evict you!" said shiva.

00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:36.016
In fact  he continued, "the police department has issued a circular -

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:45.009
no street vendor can be evicted or relocated until the bbmp conducts a survey of all street vendors and issues id cards

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.018
Any move to evict is against the new law."

00:02:48.018 --> 00:02:55.009
"what law. sir?" asked kamala."don't you know? the street vendor act of 2014

00:02:55.009 --> 00:03:01.022
but I don't have time to explain--my sister will be waiting for me. i'll tell you later!"

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:06.011
"we need to find out more about this law," said kamala. "find out what?"

00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:13.018
asked muniraju. "the police saar said we can�t be evicted , Anna," said kamala.

00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:16.023
"there is some new law. it seems."

00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:17.024
'oh!�

00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:17.024
�what happened?" asked little anita's grandmother, who had just arrived.

00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:26.017
"Ajji, some men came. they are trying to evict us."

00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:35.007
"but you people cannot go! what will I do without you? what about anita? whom will she wait with till i come?

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:43.014
my daughter can stay back late when she visits me, because she knows you'll be near the bus stop and she can wait there in safety.

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:46.019
you are like our eyes and ears on the street!"

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.021
later that night, shanthi overheard them talk about what had happened that day.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:56.006
"what is this law, appa?" "nothing,nothing," said kumar. "let's just eat."

00:03:56.006 --> 00:04:00.012
the next morning, at school. shanthi went looking for her friend jennifer.

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:06.004
"jennifer, you told me about a poster no? can you show it to me after School?"

00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:15.024
shanthi returned home late that day "where were you?" asked kamala. "i was so worried!" "amma, listen, said shanthi.

00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:28.007
"jennifer showed me a poster near her house. It says there is a meeting of street vendors tomorrow, about that new law. it is happening at the union office on DN road."

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:34.003
kumar and kamala went to the union office The next day they were met by a man and a woman.

00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:47.006
"namaskara!" said the woman. "i am neela, and this is Imran. we are a union of street vendors. we work for street vendors,and our members are all vendors like you."

00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:56.001
�Madam, "said kumar, "Recently, we were asked to leave by some men. They said a mall is going to be built near where we vend ".

00:04:56.001 --> 00:05:02.005
The next day, the gang of thugs returned. but this time, the vendors were

00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:12.003
neela, imran and other union members were with them. "you cannot evict anyone from here." said Imran. "who are you?" asked one of the thugs.

00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:27.012
"we are from the union of street vendors!" said neela. "street vending is our right. we have a new street vendors law that sa-vs no one can evict us."the thugs got angry, and attacked the vendors.

00:05:27.012 --> 00:05:35.009
shiva, the policeman, arrived just in time to stop the thugs. "stop this!" he shouted. "you are under arrest!

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:43.018
first, you cannot evict street vendors - the law clearly says that. And second, how dare you hit anyone?"

00:05:43.018 --> 00:05:52.012
"thank you sir , for coming as soon as i called you," said kumar. "no thanks needed," said shiva. "it is our duty to protect street vendors."

00:05:52.012 --> 00:05:55.016
The next week , the vendors attended the union meeting.

00:05:55.016 --> 00:06:00.022
Neela explained:�In 2014, the government of india passed a law on street vending.

00:05:55.016 --> 00:06:08.000
Under the law, street vending is lawful activity - pakka legal! that means, no one can stop you from vending.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.005
but many questions remained. "how did this law come about?� asked the vendors.

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:21.012
"what do you mean no one can stop you? will the law stop evictions? what do you mean new law?"

00:06:21.012 --> 00:06:25.006
neela and imran began answering their questions one by one.

00:06:25.006 --> 00:06:27.006
"how did this law come about?"

00:06:27.006 --> 00:06:36.023
"there was no law specifically for street vendors." said Neela. "several unions protested for a long time. First a national-level policy was launched in 2009.

00:06:36.023 --> 00:06:44.007
Then in 2013, an important case was bought in the supreme court by maharashtra ekta hawkers union.

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:49.007
It was a union of people like you and me and in 2014,

00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:57.020
the street vendors (protectionof livelihood and regulating street vending) act of 2014 became a new law.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.019
the law says street vending is your right�.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:06.016
"just as someone stealing your money is against the law, preventing you from vending is against the law.

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:12.003
with this new law, the police, government. and courts will protect your right to vend."

00:07:12.003 --> 00:07:16.020
"the new law says you have a right To vend anywhere in the country�. said imran,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:27.005
"Many people come from the north of india to work in companies like wipro and infosys in bangalore. Because as indians we can work anywhere in the country ,

00:07:27.005 --> 00:07:38.015
it is our right. the same way, people from any state can come and vend here.It is our Right. The law tells you Street vending Is pakka legal!�.

00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:42.023
The vendors had another question: "how will the government know we are street vendors?"

00:07:42.023 --> 00:07:52.014
"the bbmp has to first conduct a survey of all street vendors in the city� said imran. "under the law, no one can be evicted till the survey is done."

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:59.023
"to conduct the survey .Bbmp will Create  a town vending committee, with at Least forty percent members as street vendors,

00:07:59.023 --> 00:08:15.023
and rest from the municipality, police, NGOS, RWAS etc to implement the law. therefore, according to the law, at least 40 percent members should be street Vendors�.

00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:24.020
"but why does no one say anything about cars parked on the roads that cause jams? don't these block roads?�, asked muniraju.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:34.024
"why does everyone blame street vendors? we are just earning an honest livelihood! and what about big cars with just one person?

00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:42.006
isn't that blocking roads? why are we called 'encroachers' and not these polluting vehicles

00:08:42.006 --> 00:08:52.004
"Sometimes , the traffic police tries to evict vendors saying pedestrians don't have space to walk. and that vendors cause traffic jams.

00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:58.024
but both street vendors and pedestrians have a right to the footpath, and are dependent on each other."

00:08:58.024 --> 00:09:04.018
"and what if shopkeepers or residents threaten to move us out of the footpath?"

00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:11.005
"shops and houses have a right to ensure that access to their house or gate is not blocked,"

00:09:11.005 --> 00:09:21.002
said neela. "if we don't block that, we are not doing any wrong. Discuss any problem amicably if they insist you vacate for no reason,

00:09:21.002 --> 00:09:34.023
tell them politely that only bbmp can regulate vending. And talk to the union , sometimes the police files a petty case against vendors - under section 92 (g) of karnataka

00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:47.018
police act or section 283 of ipc. if this happens, just don't pay the fine - if you pay, it is as though you are guilty.

00:09:47.018 --> 00:09:57.020
Street vending is not a crime - it is pakka legal! tell the police that you would like to challenge the case in court and talk to the union.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:04.007
In fact, the office of the police commissioner has issued a circular ordering its officers to learn about the act.

00:10:04.007 --> 00:10:09.001
"asking for hafta is illegal. even the supreme court lamented this injustice.

00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:17.022
this is what the court said:[street vendors] are a harassed lot and are constantly victimized by the officials of the local authorities.

00:10:17.022 --> 00:10:24.005
the police. etc., who regularly target them for extra income and treat them with extreme contempt.

00:10:24.005 --> 00:10:34.004
Perhaps these minions in the administration have not understood the meaning of the term 'dignity' enshrined in the preamble of the constitution."'

00:10:34.004 --> 00:10:41.010
"the presence of street vendors generates a crowd, which prevents petty crimes from happening in public spaces.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:50.013
Be it sexual harassment or robbery. street vendors help make city spaces safer for women,the elderly and the disabled�.

00:10:50.013 --> 00:10:55.016
"for people like auto drivers and sales people.who need to travel around as part of their jobs,

00:10:55.016 --> 00:11:02.009
 vendors provide cheap, affordable food. where would these workers eat. if there were no street vendors?"

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:11.012
"street vendors are eco-friendly. they use pushcarts, bicycles, and baskets. and they don't contribute to air pollution nor do they use electricity and

00:11:11.012 --> 00:11:18.006
the street vendors federation is switching consciously to biodegradable material like banana leaves and recycled paper;

00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:25.019
"the b.b.m.p. too cannot evict street vendors. The law is clear that the b.b.m.p. has to first conduct a survey of all vendors.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:34.002
and then issue i.d. Cards , till then, no one can be evicted or relocated. the b.b.m.p. has also issued a note about this.

00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:40.004
while clearing footpaths. the bbmp. cannot violate the street vendor act.

00:11:40.004 --> 00:11:54.002
"the karnataka police manual instructs the police to behave courteously with all people. they advise the police to speak in bahuvachana (plural) and not singular."

00:11:40.004 --> 00:12:04.012
�For a second, let us think about what it means when someone tries to evict us. they are saving we are wrong to vend on the streets."

00:12:04.012 --> 00:12:18.013
"our life depends on vending. we earn very little. if we made a lot of money, we too would hire a shop Instead of standing every day in the sun, wind, rain, and smoke to make a Living .

00:12:18.013 --> 00:12:26.006
we earn through honest Means  and we don't depend on anyone we are entrepreneurs!  street vending is our right!�.

00:12:26.006 --> 00:12:32.018
"when families like ours migrate from the village, we can only do street vending or construction work.

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:36.020
vending does not have a literacy barrier, age barrier, or language barrier.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:46.007
some of us are diploma holders. when there are no government jobs or formal sector jobs for us, street vending provides us our livelihood."

00:12:46.007 --> 00:12:54.000
"can you imagine bengaluru without kr market. gandhi bazar, majestic, or 8th cross malleswaram?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.017
imagine what it means for a city to have no street vendors."

00:12:57.017 --> 00:13:02.023
�It will be a diseased city,choking on its fumes. without a Heart,without a soul."

00:13:02.023 --> 00:13:09.003
"the indian law says it is our right to vend on streets. no one can take that right from us!"

00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:13.008
"street vendors unite! together we will fight for our rights!"

00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:13.008
"street vendors unite! together we will fight for our rights!"

00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:17.015
"street vendors are the lifeblood of our cities. let us all support Them!".
