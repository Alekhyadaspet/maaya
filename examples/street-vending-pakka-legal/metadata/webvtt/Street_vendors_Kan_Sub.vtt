00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:08.001
STREET VENDING : PAKKA LEGAL!

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.013
Kumar and kamala were farmers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.017
When there were no rains, they were forced to move to the city,

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.023
leaving behind their daughter Shanthi.

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.021
With the help of some relatives, they became street vendors.

00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:24.018
In the city, they met Shantha  Mary and Muniraju.

00:00:24.018 --> 00:00:26.009
Two other vendors who sold on the same street.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:31.014
I grew up in Bangalore and live in a slum nearby, Muniraju told them .

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:38.020
For many years, I have been selling fruits. There are no other jobs for people like me without education.

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:45.018
I live in the same slum said Shantha Mary. My husband doesn�t have a job. I have two sons.

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.020
Everyday Kumar and Kamala would go to market at 3AM.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:57.007
To get fresh vegetables, carrying heavy bags and baskets in the bus.

00:00:57.023 --> 00:01:02.021
Be it rain, heat, or cold weather, they stood in their spot and vended.

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:06.008
A few months passed and slowly they started to get regular customers.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:10.018
The businessman shakeel was one such regular.

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:19.005
Another was Anitha�s grandmother. The school bus dropped little Anitha near their cart everyday,

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:23.013
and she would wait with Kamala until her grandmother picked her up.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.001
And then there was a policeman named shiva.

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:27.021
Whose sister lived nearby. But even with all these new friends,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.001
Kumar and Kamala still missed their home, and they often thought about their farm.

00:01:32.018 --> 00:01:38.010
In six months time, Kumar had found a second job as a Gardener.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.001
And kamala also found another job, supplying tea.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.005
Soon, it was almost a year since they first made the city as their home.

00:01:43.014 --> 00:01:45.013
They managed to save enough to move to a rented house,

00:01:45.016 --> 00:01:55.003
their daughter Shanthi also joined them. Little did they know what was to come.

00:01:55.011 --> 00:02:07.021
our Boss is going to build a mall here. But where will we go? asked the vendors.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.018
The thugs became aggressive. What you are doing is illegal! you can't be on the road.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:20.010
one week remember if you don't leave, you don't want to wait & find out what will happen.

00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:23.020
The next day, the policeman shiva came to their cart to buy vegetables for his sister.

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:31.002
En aithu? shiva asked. Why are you both looking so sad?

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:39.000
They are evicting us sir. But with the new law,

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.013
no one can evict you! said shiva.

00:02:43.022 --> 00:02:51.007
In fact he continued, The Police Department has issued a circular

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:57.012
no street vendor can be evicted or relocated until the BBMP conducts a survey of all

00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:05.020
street vendors and issues ID cards any move to evict is against the new law.

00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:17.000
What law sir? asked kamala. Don't you know? The Street Vendor Act of 2014

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.016
but I don't have time to explain my sister will be waiting for me. I'll tell you later!"

00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:24.005
We need to find out more about this law, said Kamala. Find out what?

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:27.011
asked Muniraju. The police saar said we can�t be evicted Anna.

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.010
There is some new law, it seems.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.013
Oh!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.003
What happened? asked little Anita's grandmother, who had just arrived.

00:03:38.014 --> 00:03:44.007
Ajji, some men came. they are trying to evict us.

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:52.023
But you people cannot go! what will I do without you? what about Anita? whom will she wait with till i come?

00:03:53.013 --> 00:03:56.017
My daughter can stay back late when she visits me, because she knows you'll be near the bus stop and

00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:04.006
she can wait there in safety. you are like our eyes and ears on the street!

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.018
later that night, shanthi overheard them talk about what had happened that day.

00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:15.021
What is this law, appa? nothing, nothing, said kumar. let's just eat.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:21.015
The next morning, at school. shanthi went looking for her friend jennifer.

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:28.018
Jennifer, you told me about a poster no? can you show it to me after School?

00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:37.002
Shanthi returned home late that day where were you? I was so worried! Amma listen said shanthi.

00:04:37.013 --> 00:04:44.014
Jennifer showed me a poster near her house. It says there is a meeting of street vendors tomorrow, about that new law.

00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:50.016
it is happening at the union office on DN road. Kumar & Kamala went to the union office The next day they were met by

00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:58.011
a man and a woman. Namaskara! said the woman. I am Neela, and this is Imran. we are a union of street vendors.

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:05.015
We work for street vendors, and our members are all vendors like you.

00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:13.001
Recently, we were asked to leave by some men. They said a Mall is going to be built near where we vend.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.020
They are wrong, said Neela. In 2014, the government of india passed a law saying Street vending is a lawful activity

00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:24.013
No one can stop you from vending. But they threatened us, said kamala.

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:29.007
Don't worry, you are not alone anymore the entire union is behind you!

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:32.004
The next day, the gang of thugs returned. but this time, the vendors were

00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:39.011
Neela, Imran and other Union members were with them. You cannot evict anyone from here. said Imran. Who are you?

00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:45.021
asked one of the thugs. you cannot evict anyone from here. said Imran. Who are you? asked one of the thugs.

00:05:46.003 --> 00:05:28.012
We are from the union of street vendors! said neela. "street vending is our right.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:06:01.007
We have a new street vendors law that says no one can evict us. The thugs got angry and attacked the vendors.

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:06.006
Shiva, the policeman, arrived just in time to stop the thugs. Stop this! he shouted. You are under arrest

00:06:06.017 --> 00:06:15.009
first, you cannot evict street vendors - the law clearly says that. And second, how dare you hit anyone?

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:24.011
Thank you sir , for coming as soon as i called you, said Kumar. No thanks needed, said Shiva.

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:29.021
It is our duty to protect street vendors. The next week, the vendors attended the union meeting.

00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:34.015
In 2014, the government of india passed a law on street vending.

00:06:34.015 --> 00:06:36.018
Under the law, street vending is lawful activity - pakka legal! that means, no one can stop you from vending.

00:06:36.018 --> 00:06:39.012
but many questions remained. How did this law come about? What do you mean no one can stop you?

00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:44.022
will the law stop evictions? what do you mean new law? Neela and Imran began answering their questions one by one.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:49.011
How did this law come about? There was no law specifically for street vendors, said Neela.

00:06:49.022 --> 00:07:03.001
Several unions protested for a long time. First a National-Level Policy was launched in 2009.

00:07:03.007 --> 00:07:07.011
Then in 2013, an important case was bought in the Supreme court by Maharashtra Ekta Hawkers Union.

00:07:08.008 --> 00:07:16.004
It was a union of people like you and me and in 2014, the street vendors (protection of livelihood and regulating street vending)

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:42.000
act of 2014 became a new law. the law says street vending is your right. Just as someone stealing your money is against the law,

00:07:42.006 --> 00:07:51.010
preventing you from vending is against the law. With this new law, the police, government. and courts will protect your right to vend.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:08:11.022
The new law says you have a right to vend anywhere in the country.

00:08:12.004 --> 00:08:21.006
Many people come from the north of india to work in companies like Wipro and Infosys in bangalore. Because as indians we can work anywhere in the country,

00:08:21.013 --> 00:08:38.014
it is our right. the same way, people from any state can come and vend here. It is our Right. The law tells you Street Vending Is Pakka Legal!�.

00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:43.009
The vendors had another question, How will the government know we are street vendors?

00:07:42.023 --> 00:07:52.014
BBMP has to first conduct a survey of all street vendors in the city. Under the law, no one can be evicted till the survey is done.

00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:49.009
To conduct the survey BBMP will Create a town vending committee, with at least 40% members as street vendors,

00:08:49.015 --> 00:09:19.020
and rest from the Municipality, police, NGOS, RWAS etc to implement the law. therefore, according to the law, at least 40% members should be street Vendors.

00:09:20.002 --> 00:09:24.004
But why does no one say anything about cars parked on the roads that cause jams? don't these block roads?

00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:29.003
Why does everyone blame street vendors? we are just earning an honest livelihood! and what about big cars with just one person?

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.021
isn't that blocking roads? why are we called 'encroachers' and not these polluting vehicles

00:09:34.003 --> 00:09:43.006
Sometimes, the traffic police tries to evict vendors saying pedestrians don't have space to walk. and that vendors cause traffic jams.

00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:46.001
But both street vendors and pedestrians have a right to the footpath, and are dependent on each other.

00:09:46.001 --> 00:09:48.039
and what if shopkeepers or residents threaten to move us out of the footpath?

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:51.040
shops and houses have a right to ensure that access to their house or gate is not blocked,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.010
If we don't block that, we are not doing any wrong. Discuss any problem amicably if they insist you vacate for no reason,

00:10:17.019 --> 00:10:24.001
tell them politely that only BBMP can regulate vending. And talk to the union, sometimes the police files a petty case against vendors under

00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:49.014
section 92(g) of karnataka police act or section 283 of IPC. if this happens, just don't pay the fine if you pay, it is as though you are guilty.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:11:02.012
Street vending is not a crime - it is pakka legal! tell the police that you would like to challenge the case in court and talk to the union.

00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:08.003
In fact, the office of the police commissioner has issued a circular ordering its officers to learn about the act.

00:11:08.003 --> 00:11:15.015
Asking for hafta is illegal. even the Supreme court lamented this injustice.

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:20.001
this is what the court said street vendors are a harassed lot and are constantly victimized by the officials of the local authorities.

00:11:20.001 --> 00:11:29.049
the police etc., who regularly target them for extra income and treat them with extreme contempt.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:50.004
Perhaps these minions in the administration have not understood the meaning of the term 'dignity' enshrined in the preamble of the constitution.

00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:36.011
The presence of street vendors generates a crowd, which prevents petty crimes from happening in public spaces.

00:11:42.007 --> 00:11:51.014
For people like auto drivers and sales people. Who need to travel around as part of their jobs,

00:11:36.018 --> 00:10:50.013
Be it sexual harassment or robbery, Street vendors help make city spaces safer for women, the elderly and the disabled.

00:10:55.016 --> 00:11:02.009
vendors provide cheap, affordable food where would these workers eat. if there were no street vendors?

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:11.012
street vendors are eco-friendly. they use pushcarts, bicycles and baskets they don't contribute to air pollution nor do they use electricity and

00:11:11.012 --> 00:11:18.006
the street vendors federation is switching consciously to biodegradable material like banana leaves and recycled paper,

00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:25.019
BBMP too cannot evict street vendors. The law is clear that the b.b.m.p. has to first conduct a survey of all vendors.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:34.002
and then issue ID Cards till then, no one can be evicted or relocated. the BBMP has also issued a note about this.

00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:40.004
while clearing footpaths. the BBMP cannot violate the street vendor act.

00:11:40.004 --> 00:11:54.002
The Karnataka police manual instructs the police to behave courteously with all people. they advise the police to speak in bahuvachana (plural) and not singular.

00:11:40.004 --> 00:12:04.012
For a second, let us think about what it means when someone tries to evict us. they are saving we are wrong to vend on the streets.

00:12:04.012 --> 00:12:18.013
Our life depends on vending. we earn very little. if we made a lot of money, we too would hire a shop instead of standing every day in the sun, wind,

00:12:18.013 --> 00:12:26.006
rain, and smoke to make a Living. We earn through honest means and we don't depend on anyone we are entrepreneurs! Street Vending is our right!�.

00:12:26.006 --> 00:12:32.018
When families like ours migrate from the village, we can only do street vending or construction work.

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:36.020
Vending does not have a literacy barrier, age barrier, or language barrier.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:46.007
Some of us are Diploma holders. when there are no government jobs or formal sector jobs for us, street vending provides us our livelihood.

00:12:46.007 --> 00:12:54.000
Can you imagine bengaluru without KR market, Gandhi Bazar, Majestic, or 8th cross Malleswaram?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.017
imagine what it means for a city to have no street vendors.

00:12:57.017 --> 00:13:02.023
It will be a diseased city, choking on its fumes. without a heart, without a soul.

00:13:02.023 --> 00:13:09.003
The indian law says it is our right to vend on streets. no one can take that right from us!"

00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:13.008
Street vendors unite! together we will fight for our rights!

00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:13.008
Street vendors unite! together we will fight for our rights!

00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:17.015
Street vendors are the lifeblood of our cities. let us all support Them!
